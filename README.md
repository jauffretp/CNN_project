Python project on using CNN with image processing
============

![Style transfer example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jauffretp/CNN_project/master/notebooks/img/chien_multicolor.jpg)



## Idea
Create something useful and fun with deep learning and image processing

## How to use

# Object detection
In the `python` folder :
- Launch the `object_detection.py` script file
- To use the webcam use the `--source webcam` option
- To try it on the pictures from  `data/random` use the `--source random` option

Example launch :
- `python3 object_detection.py --source webcam`
- `python3 object_detection.py --source random`

# Key facepoint detection

In the `python` folder :
- Launch the `keypoint_detection.py` script file

# Style transfer and training of the CNNs
- Explore the notebook folder
- In order to execute the notebooks on training the CNN, you need to download the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection)

## Requirements
- Python
- OpenCV
- Keras with tensorflow (only works on tensorflow, does NOT work on Theano)
